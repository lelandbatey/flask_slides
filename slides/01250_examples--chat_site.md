Example Flask Applications
==========================

## Chat Site

- Creates rooms
	- User sets alias, app randomly generates an id
- For each room there are different users
- Once logged into a room, a user can chat with other occupants of the room
- Has javascript/HTML front-end, with Flask backend
	- Is more complicated than prior examples
