################ Directory Cache ################
#
#
### What is the purpose of this: ###
#
# I wrote this as a simple in-memory copy of the files found on disk. All the
# files are read into memory at the beginning, and they're re-read into memory
# if they're modified, or if new files are added.
#
# There's a simple thread that is perpetually checking the directory and
# updating a data structure with the names and sizes of all files in the
# directory being cached. When it goes to read a file, it first checks that
# the in-memory data structure has all the same files as the updated
# structure, as well as checking that each in-memory file is the same size as
# the files in the updated structure. If there's a difference, it re-builds
# the entire cache then returns the requested data. If there's no difference,
# it just returns the requested data.
#
#
###     Why was this written:    ###
#
# I have a disk that can be extremely slow to seek to the start of a file.
# Sequential read and writes are fast, but reading a new file is frequently
# slow, and slow enough to notice. I wrote this so I could always read the
# data I wanted quickly, while also making sure that in-memory cache would be
# up to date if I changed a file or added a new file.
#
#
###            Notes:            ###
#
# This is the first time I've ever written anything like this. I don't know if
# there's some way to do this already, or if I could have done it better using
# some feature of python I'm not aware of. However, I'd love to learn about
# whatever mistakes or naive assumptions I've made in this code. If you do
# find something you think should be fixed, I'd really love to hear about it,
# either as a Github issue or as an email to me at lelandbatey@gmail.com
#
# Thanks for taking a look at all this, I hope it's useful/educational/humorous!
